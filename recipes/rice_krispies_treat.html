        <p>When I was 11 or 12, I remember going to a birthday party that was held in a cooking studio.</p>
        <p>That was where I learnt to make these sugar-loaded chewy treats.</p>

        <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>150g Rice Krispies Cereal</li>
            <li>3 Tablespoons Salted Butter</li>
            <li>300g Marshmallows</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Method</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Grease a 20cm x 30cm pan very well.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a large pot over low heat.</li>
            <li>Pour marshmallows into pot and melt over low heat. Stir occasionaly to prevent burning.</li>
            <li>When the marmallows have turned runny (like a thick batter), pour in the rice krispies treat and mix well.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into the pan and flatten with the back of damp spoon.</li>
            <li>Let it cool completely before cutting it into squares.</li>
        </ol>
